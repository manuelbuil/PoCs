#
# This script starts one TCP netperf session and prints latency
# (avg, mean, stdev, min, p50, p90, p99) and transaction rates.
# It stops once confidence level 99% and width of confidence
# interval of 1% has been reached.
#
# Usage: latency_netperf HOSTIP HOSTPORT TEST
#
#   HOSTIP      - Specifies the remote host IP where netserver is running.
#   HOSTPORT    - Specifies the port of netserver.
#   TEST        - The test to execute, supported is either 'CRR' or 'RR'.
#
#  Depends on a netperf version with option "-s" support, as this
#  script uses this option, to wait 2 sec before starting the test run.
